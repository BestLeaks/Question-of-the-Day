# Question and Facts **This is free to use**
Questions and Facts for F2F Bot (Fears to Fathom)

I've provided an NPM package so you may use this for yourself if you want!

If it is too difficult to edit or whatever you may just create a thread in the discussions tab. You will go off the format of what's below and I'll add it for you. 

Don't worry about the brackets, just make sure if you add more than one you put the , after it before making a new line (unless it's the final one in your list)
```
"cart or car?"
```

# Pull Requests/Suggestions
You may use the discussions tab for suggestions and help if you need it. 

I will use the issues tab to keep track things I'm doing **DO NOT MAKE ISSUES**

Pull requests are welcome if you wish to add things on your own. I'll most likely merge it. 

```json
[
"carrots or hotdogs?"
]
``` 
This is an example of an entry, if there's more than one already you add a , to the end so let's say the file looked like this: 
```json
[
"cars or trucks?",
"hotdogs or hamburgers?"
]
```
see as the last one has no , that's because it's at the end **keep this in mind if editing**
