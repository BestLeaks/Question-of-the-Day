I've provided an NPM package so you may use this for yourself if you want!

# Pull Requests/Suggestions
You may use the discussions tab for suggestions and help if you need it. 

I will use the issues tab to keep track things I'm doing **DO NOT MAKE ISSUES**

Pull requests are welcome if you wish to add things on your own. I'll most likely merge it. 

```json
[
"carrots or hotdogs?"
]
``` 
This is an example of an entry, if there's more than one already you add a , to the end so let's say the file looked like this: 
```json
[
"cars or trucks?",
"hotdogs or hamburgers?"
]
```
see as the last one has no , that's because it's at the end **keep this in mind if editing**
